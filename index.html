<p>
Iâ€™m a post doctoral associate in the University of Minnesota, twin city campus.  
I consider myself a computational biologist. 
The most time I spend in work is data mining - from experimental design, data generation to preliminary data processing, statistical modeling and data visualization.
I am familiar with basic molecular biology experiments
I have a computer science background,  have programming experiences in many computer languages and now settled on python and R.  I use python for efficient data processing and R for modeling / visualization.  I am a heavy VIM user and I edit everything in terminal.  Check my GitHub for a list of useful libraries, scripts and configuration files.
I am good at processing massive biological data through high-performance computing / cloud computing, check my GitHub for a list of pipelines I implemented for various research projects.
I am a heavy R user and I love tidyverse. I am especially good at data visualization.  I create and typeset figures or tables for publication using ggplot / Rmarkdown.

While I can spend all day long coding and data mining, there are other things that attract me after work:
Traveling: getting to see, feel and experience a place - be it a small park or national park, a new city or country - is one of my life goals
Reading: I enjoy reading classics, especially Chinese traditional literature. Check here for a list of books I read or commented.
Movies & music: get immersed in a highly-rated movie is good way for relaxing in the weekend, while music is an indispensable part of everyday life.
