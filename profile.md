## Research Experiences

### Post Doctoral Associate, Dept. of Plant and Microbial Biology, University of Minnesota

* Illucidate dynamic patterns of gene expression additivity and regulatory variation throughout maize development
* Build gene regulatory networks across maize development to understand the genetic basis of heterosis

### Graduate Research Assistant, Dept. of Plant Pathology, University of Minnesota
* Developed a computational pipeline to scan and accurately annotate small defense-related peptides in plant genomes
* Constructed *de novo* assemblies of 15 *Medicago* accessions and built a *Medicago* Pan-genome
* Systematically characterized genome-wide architecture and patterns of structural variants of defense-related gene families in *Medicago* populations
