I'm a post doctoral associate in the [Springer Lab](https://maizeumn.github.io) at the [University of Minnesota](https://twin-cities.umn.edu).

I am interested in answering complex biological questions using computational approaches:

  * Elucidation of molecular mechanisms underlying crop hybrid vigor using multi-omics approach; 
  * Data mining on rapidly growing RNA-Sequencing resources for functional gene regulations;
  * Elucidation of transcriptional regulatory differences in maize genotypes response to cold and heat stress; 
  * Integrating RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, DAP-Seq, WGBS and ATAC-Seq to improve transcriptional network construction in maize;
  * Identification and characterization of structural variation in plant genome, pan-genome architecture
  * 

Check the [Research <i class="fas fa-flask"></i>](/research) page for a list of projects I'm involved in.

I have a computer science background, have programming experiences in many computer languages but now settled on [python](https://www.python.org) and [R](https://cran.r-project.org): I use python for efficient data processing and R for modeling / visualization. I'm good at massive biological data processing, high-performance computing, cloud computing, [VIM](https://www.vim.org) and data visualization using [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org) / [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) /  [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org). Check my [GitHub](https://github.com/orionzhou) for a list of useful libraries, scripts and configuration files.

While I can spend all day long coding and data mining, here are a list of things keeping me busy after work:

  * Traveling: getting to see, feel and experience a place - be it a small park or national park, a new city or country - is one of my life goals. Check [here <i class="fas fa-images"></i>](/) for the photos I took.
  * Reading: I enjoy reading classics, especially Chinese traditional literature. Check [here <i class="fas fa-globe"></i>](https://www.douban.com/people/Genius1986/) for a list of books I read / commented.
  * Movies & music: get immersed in a highly-rated movie is good way for relaxing in the weekend, while music is an indispensable part of my everyday life.
