I'm a post doctoral associate in the [Springer Lab](https://maizeumn.github.io) at the [University of Minnesota](https://twin-cities.umn.edu).

I have a computer science background, have programming experiences in many computer languages but now settled on [python](https://www.python.org) and [R](https://cran.r-project.org): I use python for efficient data processing and R for modeling / visualization. Check my [GitHub <i class="fab fa-github-alt"></i>](https://github.com/orionzhou) for a list of useful libraries, scripts and configuration files.

I'm a heavy [VIM](https://www.vim.org) user and I edit everything in terminal <i class="fas fa-laptop-code"></i>.

I'm good at processing massive biological data through high-performance computing / cloud computing, check my [GitHub <i class="fab fa-github-alt"></i>](https://github.com/orionzhou) for a list of pipelines I implemented for various research projects.

I'm especially good at data visualization. I create and typeset figures or tables for publication using [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org) / [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com). I'm a big fan of [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org).

Most of my current work can be viewed as data mining - from experimental design, data generation to preliminary data processing, statistical modeling and data visualization. Check the [Research <i class="fas fa-flask"></i>](/research) page for a list of projects I'm involved in.

While I can spend all day long coding and data mining, here are a list of things keeping me busy after work:

  * Traveling: getting to see, feel and experience a place - be it a small park or national park, a new city or country - is one of my life goals. Check [here <i class="fas fa-images"></i>](/) for the photos I took.
  * Reading: I enjoy reading classics, especially Chinese traditional literature. Check [here <i class="fas fa-globe"></i>](https://www.douban.com/people/Genius1986/) for a list of books I read / commented.
  * Movies & music: get immersed in a highly-rated movie is good way for relaxing in the weekend, while music is an indispensable part of my everyday life.
